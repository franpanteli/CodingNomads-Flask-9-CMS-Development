-> before proceeding with this lab, ensure you have cloned the python flask labs project and opened it in vs code  
   -> if not, clone the project from github and open it in your preferred code editor (vs code recommended)  

-> learn by doing  
   -> 1. navigate to the cloned labs project and open it in vs code  
   -> 2. complete all exercises provided in the folder  
   -> 3. if you're subscribed to our membership or mentorship programs, feel free to reach out on discord for a review or help with any issues you face  
   -> 4. once you've completed the labs, make sure to push your work to github  
      -> this step is easy to overlook, but it's one of the most important parts of the process  
      -> git and github are the standard tools for version control and collaboration in software development  
      -> pushing your work to github not only backs it up but also demonstrates your progress and allows others to review your code  
      -> this practice is essential to building your professional portfolio and ensuring you're prepared for real-world development workflows  
      -> be consistent in pushing your code to github ' this is how you show that you've worked on the project and track your progress over time  
      -> github contributions (those little green squares) will show you have been actively coding and learning  

-> a friendly reminder before you move on:  
   -> did you run, review, and complete the lab?  
   -> did you push your work to github?  
   -> if the answer to either of these questions is "no", you're at risk of skipping crucial steps in the learning process  
   -> it's important to not cut corners as these habits will affect your ability to work on larger projects down the line  
   -> completing labs is a requirement for receiving your course certificate, which serves as proof of your knowledge and skills  
   -> building consistent habits of completing tasks and pushing work to github will help you become a more effective developer in the long run  

-> remember, practice makes perfect! keep doing the labs and exercises to cement your understanding and become a pro by the end of the course
