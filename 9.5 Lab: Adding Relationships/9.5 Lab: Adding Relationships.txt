-> Before proceeding with this lab, ensure you have cloned the Python Flask labs project and opened it in VS Code  
   -> If not, clone the project from GitHub and open it in your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended)  

-> Learn by Doing  
   -> 1. Navigate to the cloned labs project and open it in VS Code  
   -> 2. Complete all exercises provided in the folder  
   -> 3. If you're subscribed to our membership or mentorship programs, feel free to reach out on Discord for a review or help with any issues you face  
   -> 4. Once you've completed the labs, make sure to push your work to GitHub  
      -> This step is easy to overlook, but itÕs one of the most important parts of the process  
      -> Git and GitHub are the standard tools for version control and collaboration in software development  
      -> Pushing your work to GitHub not only backs it up but also demonstrates your progress and allows others to review your code  
      -> This practice is essential to building your professional portfolio and ensuring youÕre prepared for real-world development workflows  
      -> Be consistent in pushing your code to GitHub Ð this is how you show that youÕve worked on the project and track your progress over time  
      -> GitHub contributions (those little green squares) will show you have been actively coding and learning  

-> A friendly reminder before you move on:  
   -> Did you run, review, and complete the lab?  
   -> Did you push your work to GitHub?  
   -> If the answer to either of these questions is "no", youÕre at risk of skipping crucial steps in the learning process  
   -> ItÕs important to not cut corners as these habits will affect your ability to work on larger projects down the line  
   -> Completing labs is a requirement for receiving your course certificate, which serves as proof of your knowledge and skills  
   -> Building consistent habits of completing tasks and pushing work to GitHub will help you become a more effective developer in the long run  

-> Remember, practice makes perfect! Keep doing the labs and exercises to cement your understanding and become a pro by the end of the course
