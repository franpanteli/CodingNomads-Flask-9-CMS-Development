-> Database Management using Flask-SQLAlchemy Lesson  
   -> Running a Flask SQLAlchemy Query in Jinja Template Views  

-> Introduction  
   -> This lesson explores how to execute SQLAlchemy queries within view functions in Flask  
   -> You'll learn how to apply database querying knowledge to dynamically update content in your Jinja templates  
   -> The focus is on how and why you'd perform database operations within view functions in a Flask web application  

-> Database Example  
   -> Web applications often rely on querying a backend database to manage and display content to users  
   -> For example, on a platform like X (formerly Twitter):  
      -> A user might search for content (e.g., "sandals"), triggering a query to retrieve matching data from the database  
      -> During registration, the data entered (like a username and password) is added to the database  
      -> When the user logs in, their credentials are checked against the database to verify their identity  
      -> Posting content (e.g., a tweet) results in inserting new data into the database, followed by additional queries for things like hashtags or mentions  
   -> In your webapp, similar tasks are needed, such as:  
      -> Registering users  
      -> Verifying credentials  
      -> Storing user-generated content  
   -> All of these operations involve querying and manipulating the database, which you'll learn how to do with SQLAlchemy and Flask  

-> Add Users From Index Page  
   -> The `index` page demonstrates how to add users to the database via a form submission  
   -> Upon submitting a name:  
      -> The app checks if the username already exists in the database  
      -> If the username exists, a session variable is updated to reflect that the user is known  
      -> If the username doesn't exist, a new `User` object is created and added to the database  
   -> The code handles both adding new users and recognising returning users  
   -> Example Code:  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])  
     def index():  
         form = NameForm()  # Create form instance  
         if form.validate_on_submit():  # Check if form is submitted and valid  
             name_entered = form.name.data  # Capture entered name  
             user = User.query.filter_by(username=name_entered).first()  # Check if user exists in database  
             if user is None:  # If user doesn't exist, create a new one  
                 user = User(username=name_entered)  
                 db.session.add(user)  # Add new user to the session  
                 db.session.commit()  # Commit the transaction to the database  
                 session['known'] = False  # Mark the user as unknown in session  
             else:  
                 session['known'] = True  # If user exists, mark as known  
             session['name'] = name_entered  # Store the entered name in session  
             flash('Great! We hope you enjoy the community')  # Display a flash message  
             form.name.data = ''  # Clear the form field  
             return redirect(url_for('index'))  # Redirect back to the index page  
         return render_template('index.html', form=form, name=session.get('name'), known=session.get('known', False))  # Render the template with session data  
     ```  
   -> In this example, when a user submits their name, the application checks the database for an existing user and updates the session accordingly  

-> Jinja Template With A Customised Greeting  
   -> The Jinja template dynamically displays a personalised greeting based on whether the user is known or not  
   -> If the user is new, they will be greeted with a message like "Nice to meet you!"  
   -> If the user has visited before, they will see a message like "Enjoy your stay"  
   -> The template integrates with the form, updating dynamically based on the session data  
   -> Example Template:  
     ```html  
     {% block page_content %}  
     <h1>Welcome to Ragtime, {% if name %}{{name}}{% else %}Anonymous{% endif %}</h1>  <!-- Personalised greeting -->  
     <div class="page-header">  
         {% if not known %}  <!-- Check if the user is known or new -->  
         <p>Mucho gusto! (Nice to meet you!)</p>  <!-- Greeting for new users -->  
         {% else %}  
         <p>Enjoy your stay</p>  <!-- Greeting for returning users -->  
         {% endif %}  
     </div>  
     {{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}  <!-- Render the form using Flask-WTF -->  
     {% endblock page_content %}  
     ```  
   -> This template displays a dynamic greeting based on the `name` and `known` values in the session, giving users a personalised experience  

-> Summary: How to Run a Flask SQLAlchemy Query in Jinja Template Views  
   -> SQLAlchemy queries are performed within Flask view functions to interact with the database  
   -> Jinja templates allow you to dynamically display content based on data from the database and session  
   -> In this lesson, you learned how to:  
      -> Perform database queries within a Flask view function  
      -> Add and check for users in the database  
      -> Use Flask sessions to store and display personalised information to users in Jinja templates  
   -> This enables your web app to be data-driven and responsive to user interactions, providing a seamless experience from backend to frontend
